TO-DO LIST: (so i don't forget everything i need to do)

1. About Me Button
    - Make the button look nicer (fit in better? maybe fixed position?)
    - Add JS to the about me button (so it actually works lol)
    - Add something below the hero section so you don't see the About Me part before you scroll
2. Display the nav bar one you scroll
3. Fix the Hero Section so everything looks nice
