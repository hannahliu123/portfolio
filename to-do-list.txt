TO-DO LIST: (so i don't forget everything i need to do)

1. About Me Button
    - Make the button look nicer (fit in better? maybe fixed position?)
    - Add JS to the about me button (so it actually works lol)
    - Add something below the hero section so you don't see the About Me part before you scroll
    - Make the down arrow appear when scrolling is detected (JS)
2. Display the nav bar one you scroll past hero section
3. Fix the Hero Section so everything looks nice

Later:
- About Me
- Photos scroll panel
- Languages? Maybe... still debating
- Featured Projects
- Recent Life Updates
- Footer Contacts
- Nav Bar
- Link to this GitHub
- Fix all colors
- Dark Mode?
- New pages for all projects & blog/life updates
- Add some kind of statistics bar with hours spent coding this website? Maybe current book reading (BONUS)
- Maybe a way for me to login and edit my posts??? (BONUS)
