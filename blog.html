            <p>Placeholder for Lightbringer review</p>
            <p>LOVE the author (every little detail ends up mattering and gets me wondering what it might mean) and the book is so well thought out. Almost each chapter ends in a cliffhanger and I'm FORCED to keep reading. It gets me so emotional like I'm in the story (CASSIUS NOOOO)</p>
            <p>Fav quotes: </p>
            <q>"He sighs. 'Darrow, this is a thirty-megaton atomic warhead.' I smile. 'He has a big personality.' 'Well, then Apollonius should love him.'"</q>
            <q>"Do not worry for her. Pity them." -Victra's message to Mustang page 245</q>
            <q>"That bloodydamn Bellona. That arrogant Peerless sh*t. I'm going to break his knee if I ever see him again" -page 3 (oh how faaaar we've come) D:</q>
            <q>"I thought it would be Ares's name that they shouted before death. Or Eo's name. But no. It was mine." - page 475 AHHHHHH DARROW</q>
            <q>"If I ever see you again, I will kill you" -Pytha page 666</q>
            <q>"'Honestly, Darrow, atomics, warlord heads. I thought our honeymoon would be more romantic.' 'Honeymoon.' 'Yes. Apparently we're a couple till Virginia fights me for you.'" -page 590</q>
            <q>"'What? Did somebody compliment me?' he asks. 'It's the jawline. Isn't it selfless, really. I take the pressure off everyone else. They don't have to worry about being the most handsome in the room. They can just be. Ah. Hvae is the chin that sets the bar.'" -Cassius page 581</q>
            <q>"Go on now. Before I try to keep you." -Cas page 466</q>
            <q>"'They give each individual tree a name... They said they sing to then and it makes the trees happy, and a happy tree produces better fruit... They said the trees were their children, and they will die with them. Then they spat on me.' He turns. He looks miserable." -Cicero page 665</q>
            <q>"I am Cassius Bellona, son of Tiberius, son of Julia, brother of Darrow, Morning Knight of the Solar Republic, and my honor remains." -Cas page 641</q>
            <q>"But if it must be guilt that drags you down, brother, I will be your millstone" - page 640</q>
            <q>"Clang clang clang. CONFESSSSS" -Darrow 552</q>
            <q>"HAIL LIBERTAS! HAIL REAPER!!!!!!!!"</q>
            <q>"If your heart beats like a drum, and your leg's a little wet, it's 'cause the Reaper's come to collect a little debt." - Sevro GoOlden Son</q>
            <q>"But guess where he came out? Come on. Guess. Guess!” “Sevro, did he come out the sea demon's rectum?” I ask. Sevro squeals with laughter. “He did! Right out the ass. Shot like a turd—” My chair rolls to a stop. His voice cut short, followed by a thump and sliding sound. My wheelchair rolls forward again. I look back and see Ragnar pushing it innocently along. Sevro isn't in the hallway behind us. I frown, wondering where he went, till he bursts out of a side passage. “You! Troll!” Sevro shouts. “I'm a terrorist warlord! Stop throwing me. You made me drop my candy!” Sevro looks at the floor of the hallway. “Wait. Where is it? Dammit, Ragnar. Where is my peanut bar? You know how many people I had to kill to get that. Six! Six!” Ragnar chews quietly above me, and though I'm probably mistaken, I think I see him smile." -Morning Star</q>
            <p>My opinions on each character: Sevro, Idiot Jackal, Lysander (something about pandemonium chair, he also built his life on lies so like that can't end well), cassius (best character development EVER), ephriam, darrow/virgina (but not much to talk about), pallas (somethings off but i like pallas), cicero (i think he'll betray the lune), pax (red god?), athena</p>
            <p>Red God predictions!!! Edeimi, quicksilver, atlantia, figment, obsidians, abomination, pandemonium chair</p>
