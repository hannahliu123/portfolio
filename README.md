# Welcome to my Personal Website!
Hi, I'm Hannah, and this is my personal website which created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a few tools in Firebase. I started this project with some very basic knowledge of web development, so I can't believe how far I've come in coding this portfolio. I have poured out my heart and soul on this project, spending over 70 hours on this website alone. I'm super proud of all the features I've added, especially my use of Firebase and Javascript.<br/><br/>
I had a TON of fun throughout this process, and I actually bought my own domain for this website and implemented hosting & data storage in Firebase. I hope you'll check it out! Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or feedback. I truly appreciate it!
